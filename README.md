# DSA120_Assignment
My assignment for first year computing unit at Curtin, Data Structures and Algorithms.

##Overview Of Question
"Your task is to write a program that can load a large table of student numbers/names (up to 10,000) and allow the user to perform fast searches for students based on their name. The user must be able to type only the first part of a name in and the system will retrieve all names that begin with the entered substring. Multiple searches are to be expected. The user must be able to save the list of students matching the last search to disk.
When the program starts up, it should show the following main menu:

(1) – Load Students  
(2) – Search for Single Student  
(3) – Search for List of Students  
(4) – Save Matches  
(5) – Quit  
Choice:>  

The user enters in their choice and the system executes the desired option (possibly involving further user input). After the option has completed processing, the main menu should be re-displayed."

###Usage
Run from StudentSearch class "java StudentSearch" and load the provided test file, RandomNames7000.csv

###Note
Making this assignment public after 6 months of finishing / handing in. Version here on git appears to be missing most commenting / documentation for some reason. Will do best to find and fix.
